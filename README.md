## **About Me**

My favorite sport is hockey, I have been playing hockey for about 7 years now. I currently play roller and ice hockey. My favorite NHL team is the Anaheim Ducks which is why I have the username AnaheimDucks16. I also have another hobby which is coding Discord bots in Node.js, which I've been doing for about a little under a year. I got interested in coding by seeing what bots can do, it all started when I made a Youtube channel which needed a Discord server and we needed bots. So I decided to learn how to make one. I am currently in High School. Feel free to contact me through any of the links above! For the quickest response please email me at `groupplayzdevs@gmail.com` or by joining my [Discord](https://discord.gg/UVSVGf5auF) support server.
